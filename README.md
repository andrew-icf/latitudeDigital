Working with screen shots to build as much of an app as possible using React Native, here are some notes that I have found:
1. There is no "horizontal rule" < hr > in React Native, they are currently trying to get it working with < Text /> and <        TextInput /> but the only way to do it right now is to wrap it with < View > tags which seems pretty hacky. There is a npm    module react-native-hr that looks like that would be an easy fix, just a reminder to check it out.
